# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn add --dev hardhat
yarn add --dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
yarn add @openzeppelin/contracts @aave/core-v3 dotenv
yarn add "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers@^1.0.0" "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers@^1.0.0" "@types/mocha@^9.1.0" "@typechain/hardhat@^6.1.2" "hardhat-gas-reporter@^1.0.8" "solidity-coverage@^0.8.1" "ts-node@>=8.0.0" "typescript@>=4.5.0"
```
